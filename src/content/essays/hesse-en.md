Hermann Hesse’s novels often revolve around characters who feel alienated from the world around them. Whether in *Steppenwolf* or *Siddhartha*, the journey is less about physical movement and more about inner transformation.

Hesse portrays the self as something fluid rather than fixed. Identity is not discovered once, but reshaped again and again through suffering, reflection, and moments of insight. This makes his writing particularly resonant in times of personal or cultural crisis.

In reading Hesse, we are invited to see our own contradictions not as failures, but as necessary stages in a larger process of becoming. The self, in this sense, is not a destination, but a path that never fully ends.
