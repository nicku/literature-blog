Hi!  
My name is Nick, and I’m a graduate of the Arzim Program with a Master’s degree in Mathematics. I really enjoy reading and analyzing books, and I started this blog to share summaries and insights that emerged during my reading.  

Over the past five years, I have written the final presentation for the *Gachliliot* project, which supports young people facing challenges in Holon.  

My stories and poems have appeared on various platforms, including the *“Fathers”* exhibition at the Beit HaOmanut Museum in Bat Yam, the *“Men’s Day”* exhibition organized by the Municipality of Petah Tikva, and in the magazine *“BeEinayha”* (edited by Dr. Zamira Poran-Zion).
